## **Credits** üë•

The project has been originally developed by **LAB2R** (Laboratory of Survey and Representation) and **LabMGF** (Geodetic and Photogrammetric Laboratory) coordinated by Professor [Livio Pinto](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Livio-Pinto) at Politecnico di Milano - Piacenza campus.

The in situ survey was part of the laboratories for the [**RELIEF TECHNIQUE AND 3D MODELING FOR THE ARCHITECTURE**](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=735710&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=93e89e7f2db93a52f4de53beb4e38ea2) course from the Bachelor of Science Degree in Architectural Design. Drone surveys and laser scanner acquisitions were conducted and pre-processed by [Federico Barbieri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-barbieri-8006a0228/), [Rebecca Fascia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-fascia-a82b10223/) and [Francesco Ioli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-ioli-640061160/)

The collected data were first processed within the research thesis project entitled *Galleria Ricci Oddi: Indagine storica - rilievo e rappresentazione del complesso architettonico* by Gaia Castelli.

The digital twin platform implementation was carried by [Federica Gaspari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicagaspari/).

# riccio3di
A web app for exploring in 3D an art exhibition based on Potree JS.

A working example can be found on the [LabMGF@PoliMi](https://labmgf.dica.polimi.it/pujob/riccio3di/) website.

## **How to install and run** ‚öô

Make sure you have the following installed and working in order to reproduce the project. You can view detailed installation guidelines within the following links:
* [Xampp / Apache server](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
* [Github to clone project](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once you cloned this repository, make sure that it is located inside the *xampp/htdocs* directory. The web app will then be accessible by connecting to the url *localhost/riccio3di/*.

In order to enable the db connection for annotations loading, install PostgreSQL and create a new database containing a table for artworks information. For the Ricci Oddi case study, PostgreSQL 16.1 version has been used.
Then, fix the connection credentials in index.php according to your case.

## **License**

For continuity sake, this project carries the same license as the original Potree project. More information can be found in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Tars4815/riccio3di/blob/main/LICENCE) file.

## **Credits** üë•

The project has been originally developed by **LAB2R** (Laboratory of Survey and Representation) and **LabMGF** (Geodetic and Photogrammetric Laboratory) coordinated by Professor [Livio Pinto](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Livio-Pinto) at Politecnico di Milano - Piacenza campus.

The in situ survey was part of the laboratories for the [**RELIEF TECHNIQUE AND 3D MODELING FOR THE ARCHITECTURE**](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=735710&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=93e89e7f2db93a52f4de53beb4e38ea2) course from the Bachelor of Science Degree in Architectural Design. Drone surveys and laser scanner acquisitions were conducted and pre-processed by [Federico Barbieri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-barbieri-8006a0228/), [Rebecca Fascia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-fascia-a82b10223/) and [Francesco Ioli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-ioli-640061160/)

The collected data were first processed within the research thesis project entitled *Galleria Ricci Oddi: Indagine storica - rilievo e rappresentazione del complesso architettonico* by Gaia Castelli.

The digital twin platform implementation was carried by [Federica Gaspari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicagaspari/).
